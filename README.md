# My Notes

1. Each Angular library name begins with the @angular prefix.
2. A component controls a patch of screen called a view.
3. Registering at a component level means you get a new instance of the service with each new instance of that component. While, In general, add providers to the root module so that the same instance of a service is available everywhere.
